# Universal Engineering Baseline
- **Principles**: DRY • SOLID • Composition over inheritance • Clear boundaries • Small, cohesive modules.
- **Patterns (GoF)** — use when they reduce complexity: Strategy, Adapter, Facade, Decorator, Composite, Observer/Pub-Sub, Command, Factory/Abstract Factory.
- **Testability first**: favor pure functions, injected dependencies, thin I/O edges.
- **Complexity & size (targets)**:
  - Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10 (warn ≥ 8, refactor > 10)
  - Function length ≤ 30 lines; files/components ≤ 300 lines
  - Props/params ≤ 7; prefer cohesive objects
- **Error handling**: explicit, no swallowed errors; include actionable messages.
- **Docs**: 1–2 line purpose header per file; JSDoc/GoDoc/docstrings for public APIs.
- **A11y/UI (when applicable)**: semantic HTML; use platform components correctly.

# How to Respond
1. **Plan first** (bullets with options + trade-offs).
2. **Code next** (small, reviewable diff).
3. **Tests** (unit before integration/E2E where possible).
4. **Refactor** if duplication or complexity creeps up (prefer Strategy/Adapter/Facade).

---

# Testing Matrix (defaults)
- **Go**: testing + testify (or gotest table-driven); integration via Docker/Testcontainers if needed.
- **Python**: pytest (+ pytest-bdd when behavior matters).
- **JS/TS**: Jest or Vitest; React Testing Library for components; Playwright for E2E.
- **zsh**: BATS (or lightweight script harness); mock external commands.

---

# Tooling & Style
- **Go**: gofmt/goimports; golangci-lint; modules per package; contexts for I/O; interfaces at consumer side.
- **Python**: ruff (lint+import sort), black (format), mypy where value > cost; type hints for public APIs.
- **JS/TS**: eslint (import, jsx-a11y, @typescript-eslint), prettier; path aliases; strict TS.
- **zsh**: shellcheck (lint), shfmt (format); no unguarded set -e; prefer set -Eeuo pipefail.
- **Git**: Conventional commits with Angular convention (feat:, fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, chore:, etc.) using sane scopes (e.g., feat(auth): add OAuth2 support, fix(api): resolve rate limiting issue)

# Language Playbooks

## Go
- **Project shape**: internal/, pkg/, cmd/…; small packages with clear contracts.
- **Patterns**:
  - Strategy for variant algorithms (pricing, routing, backoff).
  - Adapter to wrap SDKs/HTTP clients (export small interfaces).
  - Facade to simplify multi-step workflows.
  - Decorator for logging/metrics/caching around interfaces.
- **Testing**: table-driven tests; use fakes over heavy mocks; benchmark critical code.

### Go Strategy sketch
```go
type PriceStrategy interface{ Calc(Order) int }
type Retail struct{}; func (Retail) Calc(o Order) int { /* ... */ return 0 }
type Wholesale struct{}; func (Wholesale) Calc(o Order) int { /* ... */ return 0 }

func ChooseStrategy(o Order) PriceStrategy {
    if o.Type == "wholesale" { return Wholesale{} }
    return Retail{}
}
```

## Python
- **Structure**: src layout, services (facades), adapters (I/O), domain (pure).
- **Patterns**: Strategy via simple callables/Protocol; Adapter around clients; Facade modules for workflows.
- **Testing**: pytest; isolate side effects; fixtures for boundaries.

### Python Strategy sketch
```python
from typing import Protocol

class PriceStrategy(Protocol):
    def calc(self, order: "Order") -> int: ...

class Retail:
    def calc(self, order): ...

class Wholesale:
    def calc(self, order): ...

def choose_strategy(order) -> PriceStrategy:
    return Wholesale() if order.type == "wholesale" else Retail()
```

## JavaScript / TypeScript
- **Defaults**: strict TS, path aliases, ESLint+Prettier; prefer pure utilities + small components/hooks.
- **Patterns**: Strategy for branching, Adapter for fetch/SDKs, Facade for features; Decorator for cross-cutting.
- **React/Next**: Prefer Server Components; "use client" only when necessary; data access behind facades; RTL for components.

### TS Strategy sketch
```typescript
export interface PriceStrategy { calc(o: Order): number }
export class Retail implements PriceStrategy { calc(o) { /*...*/ return 0 } }
export class Wholesale implements PriceStrategy { calc(o) { /*...*/ return 0 } }
export const chooseStrategy = (o: Order): PriceStrategy =>
  o.type === "wholesale" ? new Wholesale() : new Retail();
```

## zsh
- **Guidelines**: small functions, no global state; pass args explicitly; trap errors; document usage.
- **Testing**: BATS where feasible; stub external cmds; keep scripts POSIX-ish when portability matters.

### zsh utility sketch
```bash
# purpose: print a header line
print_header() {
  emulate -L zsh
  set -Eeuo pipefail
  local msg="${1:?message required}"
  printf '\n=== %s ===\n' "$msg"
}
```

# Refactoring Heuristics
- Replace deep if/else with map dispatch or Strategy.
- Extract pure domain functions; push side effects to edges.
- Introduce Facades to collapse multi-step orchestration.
- Use Adapters to quarantine flaky/external APIs.
- Add Decorators for logging/metrics/caching without touching core logic.

---

# Definition of Done
- ✅ DRY & SOLID honored; chosen pattern reduces complexity.
- ✅ Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10; functions/components sized reasonably.
- ✅ Unit tests for new logic; integration/E2E for user-visible flows.
- ✅ Errors & empty states handled; no swallowed exceptions.
- ✅ Lint/format/type checks clean; minimal, reviewable diff.
- ✅ Short rationale & usage notes (docstring or PR description).

# Quick Command Prompts (reuse)

## Design then Code
Propose 2–3 designs with trade-offs; pick one; implement in a tiny diff with unit tests. Prefer Strategy/Adapter/Facade where they reduce branching.

## Make it Testable
Extract pure logic and inject dependencies; provide example tests (Go table-driven / pytest / Jest).

## Reduce Complexity
Identify functions > 10 complexity or > 30 lines; propose refactor steps; apply Strategy or Facade.

## Eliminate Duplication
Find duplicated logic; extract shared utility/hook/module; add tests and usage notes.
