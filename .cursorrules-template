# Universal Engineering Baseline
- **Principles**: DRY • SOLID • Composition over inheritance • Clear boundaries • Small, cohesive modules
- **Patterns (GoF)**: Use when they reduce complexity: Strategy, Adapter, Facade, Decorator, Composite, Observer/Pub-Sub, Command, Factory/Abstract Factory
- **Testability first**: Favor pure functions, injected dependencies, thin I/O edges
- **Complexity & size targets**:
  - Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10 (warn ≥ 8, refactor > 10)
  - Function length ≤ 30 lines; files/components ≤ 300 lines
  - Props/params ≤ 7; prefer cohesive objects
- **Error handling**: Explicit, no swallowed errors; include actionable messages
- **Documentation**: 1–2 line purpose header per file; JSDoc/GoDoc/docstrings for public APIs
- **A11y/UI**: Semantic HTML; use platform components correctly

# How to Respond
1. **Plan first** (bullets with options + trade-offs)
2. **Code next** (small, reviewable diff)
3. **Tests** (unit before integration/E2E where possible)
4. **Refactor** if duplication or complexity creeps up (prefer Strategy/Adapter/Facade)

# Testing Matrix
- **Go**: testing + testify (or gotest table-driven); integration via Docker/Testcontainers if needed
- **Python**: pytest (+ pytest-bdd when behavior matters)
- **JS/TS**: Jest or Vitest; React Testing Library for components; Playwright for E2E
- **zsh**: BATS (or lightweight script harness); mock external commands

# Tooling & Style
- **Go**: gofmt/goimports; golangci-lint; modules per package; contexts for I/O; interfaces at consumer side
- **Python**: ruff (lint+import sort), black (format), mypy where value > cost; type hints for public APIs
- **JS/TS**: eslint (import, jsx-a11y, @typescript-eslint), prettier; path aliases; strict TS
- **zsh**: shellcheck (lint), shfmt (format); no unguarded set -e; prefer set -Eeuo pipefail
- **Git**: Conventional commits with Angular convention (feat:, fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, chore:, etc.) using sane scopes

# Language-Specific Guidelines

## Python (Primary for this project)
- **Structure**: src layout, services (facades), adapters (I/O), domain (pure)
- **Patterns**: Strategy via simple callables/Protocol; Adapter around clients; Facade modules for workflows
- **Testing**: pytest; isolate side effects; fixtures for boundaries
- **Code quality**: Use ruff for linting, black for formatting, type hints for public APIs

## JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Defaults**: Strict TS, path aliases, ESLint+Prettier; prefer pure utilities + small components/hooks
- **Patterns**: Strategy for branching, Adapter for fetch/SDKs, Facade for features; Decorator for cross-cutting
- **React/Next**: Prefer Server Components; "use client" only when necessary; data access behind facades; RTL for components

## Go
- **Project shape**: internal/, pkg/, cmd/…; small packages with clear contracts
- **Patterns**: Strategy for variant algorithms, Adapter to wrap SDKs/HTTP clients, Facade to simplify multi-step workflows
- **Testing**: Table-driven tests; use fakes over heavy mocks; benchmark critical code

# Refactoring Heuristics
- Replace deep if/else with map dispatch or Strategy
- Extract pure domain functions; push side effects to edges
- Introduce Facades to collapse multi-step orchestration
- Use Adapters to quarantine flaky/external APIs
- Add Decorators for logging/metrics/caching without touching core logic

# Definition of Done
- ✅ DRY & SOLID honored; chosen pattern reduces complexity
- ✅ Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10; functions/components sized reasonably
- ✅ Unit tests for new logic; integration/E2E for user-visible flows
- ✅ Errors & empty states handled; no swallowed exceptions
- ✅ Lint/format/type checks clean; minimal, reviewable diff
- ✅ Short rationale & usage notes (docstring or PR description)

# Project-Specific Rules
- **Web Scraping**: Use Playwright internally to load and render roster URL pages before parsing (many sites use JavaScript rendering)
- **AWS Integration**: Follow AWS best practices for Lambda, DynamoDB, and other services
- **Data Processing**: Maintain clear separation between scraping, parsing, transformation, and storage layers
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with actionable messages and proper logging
- **Configuration**: Use dependency injection and configuration management for flexible deployment scenarios
